# How to Contribute

There are a few guidelines that we need external contributors to follow so that we are able to process requests as efficiently as possible.

If you have any questions or concerns please contact a project maintainer who is an active community leader.

Follow these steps:

1. [Getting Started](#getting-started)
2. [Making Changes](#making-changes)
3. [Submitting Changes](#submitting-changes)

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Submit an [issue](../../issues), assuming one does not already exist.
    - Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
    - Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch off of `main` before you start your work.
    - Please avoid working directly on the `main` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
    - You may be asked to squash unnecessary commits down to logical units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Write meaningful, descriptive commit messages which follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.
* Please follow existing code conventions when working on a file.

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository in the [WarnerMedia](https://github.com/WarnerMedia) organization.
    - You will be prompted to accept the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) as part of setting up your first Pull Request.
* After feedback has been given, we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request (if it isn't showing any activity).
* Bug fixes or features that lack appropriate tests may not be considered for merge.
* Changes that lower test coverage may not be considered for merge.
