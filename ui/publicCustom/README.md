# publicCustom Directory

Place any files in this directory that you want to either replace default files in the `public` directory (e.g. application icon files such as `favicon.ico`) or you want to have added to the `public` directory.
These files will be copied into the project's `public` directory when the `npm install` `postinstall` script runs.
