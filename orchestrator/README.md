# Heimdall

## Overview

Artemis Scan Orchestrator

> Heimdall is attested as possessing foreknowledge, keen eyesight and hearing, and keeps watch for invaders and the onset of Ragnar√∂k while drinking fine mead in his dwelling Himinbj√∂rg, located where the burning rainbow bridge Bifr√∂st meets the sky. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimdallr)

Heimdall is a tool for initiating Artemis scans across a large set of services, repositories, and branches at once. At its broadest, it can be configured to initate a full Artemis scan of every branch of every repository in every service that Artemis supports on a recurring schedule. Multiple different scans can be configured to run on different schedules, each with a different scan configuration, such as limiting the set of plugins run to target just secrets detection or just scanning a particualar service and organization or just scanning the primary branch of every repository. Additionally, Heimdall has a REST API for initiating scans in an ad-hoc manner. Artemis scans initiated by Heimdall receive lower priority by Artemis and are always processed after any scans initiated via the UI or CI integrations.

## Supported Version Control Systems

Heimdall can schedule scans in the following Version control systems:

- [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops)
- [Bitbucket Cloud v2](https://bitbucket.org/product)
- [Bitbucket Enterprise Server v1](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/enterprise)

## Local Development

### Running Tests

To run unit-tests:

```sh
make unit-test ENV=example
```

## Deployment

### üö¢ Initial Deployment

1. Create a new environment in `terraform/environments`, copying the example and modifing as needed.
2. Create S3 buckets and ECR repositories: `terraform -chdir=terraform/environments/ENV apply -target module.heimdall.aws_s3_bucket.heimdall_files`
3. Copy `example.mk` to a new `.mk` file that matches the name of the environment created in step 1. The `Makefile` expects `nonprod.mk` to exist by default but can be overridden by setting the `ENV` var to a different value when running make (`make ENV=name`).
4. Build, upload, and stage artifacts: `make upload_lambdas`
5. Deploy the rest of the Terraform: `terraform -chdir=terraform/environments/ENV apply`
6. Create an Artemis API key and store it in Secrets Manager

### Lambda Deployments

After the initial deployments are complete, run these commands in the [orchestrator directory](../orchestrator/) to deploy the Heimdall Lambdas:

```sh
make build              # Build all lambdas
make upload_lambdas     # Upload lambdas to s3
make deploy_lambdas     # Deploys all lambda
make clean              # Cleans up the build directories
```

Lambdas and Layers can be deployed independently through other commands. To view all available commands run:

```sh
make help
```

### Terraform Deployments

After the initial deployments are complete, updates to the terraform configurations can be deployed using these commands:

```sh
cd /terraform/environments/<insert_environment_name>
terraform apply
```
