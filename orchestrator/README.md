# Heimdall

Artemis Scan Orchestrator

>Heimdall is attested as possessing foreknowledge, keen eyesight and hearing, and keeps watch for invaders and the onset of Ragnar√∂k while drinking fine mead in his dwelling Himinbj√∂rg, located where the burning rainbow bridge Bifr√∂st meets the sky. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimdallr)

Heimdall is a tool for initiating Artemis scans across a large set of services, repositories, and branches at once. At its broadest, it can be configured to initate a full Artemis scan of every branch of every repository in every service that Artemis supports on a recurring schedule. Multiple different scans can be configured to run on different schedules, each with a different scan configuration, such as limiting the set of plugins run to target just secrets detection or just scanning a particualar service and organization or just scanning the primary branch of every repository. Additionally, Heimdall has a REST API for initiating scans in an ad-hoc manner. Artemis scans initiated by Heimdall receive lower priority by Artemis and are always processed after any scans initiated via the UI or CI integrations.

## üö¢  Initial Deployment

1. Create a new environment in `terraform/environments`, copying the example and modifing as needed.
2. Create S3 buckets and ECR repositories: `terraform -chdir=terraform/environments/ENV apply -target module.heimdall.aws_s3_bucket.heimdall_files`
3. Copy `example.mk` to a new `.mk` file that matches the name of the environment created in step 1. The `Makefile` expects `nonprod.mk` to exist by default but can be overridden by setting the `ENV` var to a different value when running make (`make ENV=name`).
4. Build, upload, and stage artifacts: `make upload_lambdas`
5. Deploy the rest of the Terraform: `terraform -chdir=terraform/environments/ENV apply`
6. Create an Artemis API key and store it in Secrets Manager
