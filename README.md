# 🛡️ Artemis: Hunt For Security Issues In Source Code

Artemis is an extensible source code scanning tool developed by the WarnerMedia CSO Application Security team that provides a single interface for running multiple security analysis tools against a source code repository, regardless of the contents of the repository. Artemis can scan repositories in different GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Azure DevOps organizations from a single, unified platform.
