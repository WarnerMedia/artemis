# Users API to support the user interface for Artemis

## Deployment troubleshooting

When deploying this API for the very first time in a new environment note that it is neccessary
to use the AWS console to finish the deployment.  Navigate to API Gateway service section in the console
and click on artemis-users-handler from the list of API links.  Click on the Actions dropdown button and
click on "Deploy API" to finish the deployment.  This only needs to be done once.
